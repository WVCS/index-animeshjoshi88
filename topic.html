  <p>  Julius Randle is the starting power forward for the New York Knicks. He is widely considered to be the best player on the team, and last year, he managed to lead them to a playoff position. Last season he was recognized as an NBA all star, and was appointed to the All-NBA second team. He averaged 24.1 points, 10.2 rebounds and 6 assists in that season. This year his production has slightly dropped, as he now only averages 19.8 points per game, and the knicks are currently outside of the playoff picture. Julius Randle's game involves a healthy number of post-ups, mid-range shots, catch and shoot jumper, as well as crafty finishes. The fadeaway is considered to be his signature shot, as he uses this move to devastate defenses time after time, throughout each game.
